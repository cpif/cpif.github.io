title: About this Site
---

This site is proudly JavaScript and PHP-free. It uses no
databases, no Wordpress, no CMS. I write all the content in
markdown, and static HTML pages are generated using John
MacFarlane's wonderful [Pandoc] and the equally wonderful [Fish
shell].

To reduce the number of queries, I use an embedded stylesheet.
Ideally, I will soon abandon CSS altogether.[^1]
