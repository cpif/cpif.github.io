<p>I don’t like Microsoft Word. Or Google Docs. Word crashes; its feature list is amazing, but difficult to navigate; synchronization problems make it behave erratically; its not free. Google Docs is better, but I dislike having to work online.</p>
<p>This past year, I decided to explore alternative options to the traditional word processor. At first, my motivations were simple: I wanted something with a little more stability and a less distracting interface.</p>
<p>While I was thinking about this, I was unrelatedly exploring the utilities available in the UNIX shell. These are small little computer programs that do simple tasks – everything from listing the files in a directory, to sorting lists alphabetically, to printing the current date and time. And more complicated things, as well.</p>
<p>Eventually, these two interests began to converge, and I put together – thanks in no small part to the wealth of tutorials available online – a writing “stack” that has more-or-less replaced Word and Docs for many of my writing tasks.</p>
<p>I call it a “stack” because most of the features that are rolled into one program – the word processor – are now, for me, separate programs. This creates a greater degree of flexibility: if one of the tools fails, it can be replaced with another, while the rest remain stable. All of these are free – and a few may already be installed on your computer.</p>
<h1 id="the-stack">The Stack</h1>
<p><strong><a href="https://neovim.io/">Nvim</a></strong>: for text editing. When I write, this is the program I write in. I’ll write more about why I like nvim in particular in a future post. For now, the important thing to point out is that any text editor will do: Notepad is the default on Windows, TextEdit on Mac. All that matters is that the program should edit plain text files. These are much simpler, smaller files than Word documents or PDFs, and consequently load more quickly and are much less prone to crashes. They’re also, usually much less feature-rich and therefore less distracting.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a></strong>: for typesetting and file conversion. This program converts the plaintext files I compose into more familiar formats like Word and PDF. It can also convert to PowerPoint, HTML, and a number of other formats. Pandoc was developed by John MacFarlane, professor of Philosophy at Berkeley.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a></strong>: for formatting. Markdown isn’t a program, it’s a convention for specifying text formatting. For example, if you type <code>*this*</code> or <code>_this_</code>, markdown understands that you want to italicize <em>this</em>. If you begin a line with <code>&gt;</code> it will understand that line as a blockquote. When pandoc converts your text file to Word, it will automatically take those formatting symbols into account.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a></strong>: for version control. This is the equivalent of Word’s “track changes” feature, with a little twist. I like to call it a “dumb” version of track changes: it does not automatically keep track of changes to your files; instead, it waits for you to ask it to note any changes you’ve made, and prompts you to leave a comment explaining what you’ve done. This takes a little getting used to if, like me, you’re accustomed to software keeping track of changes you’ve made automatically. But it forces you to be more conscious of and thoughtful about your revision process.</p>
<h1 id="why">Why?</h1>
<p>Aside from ditching the traditional word processor, here are some reasons you might want to explore some of these tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>As I said, they’re more stable and more distraction-free.</li>
<li>If you’re worried (or hopeful) that Microsoft will go out of business, the files you produce in these ways will still be available to you. They can be opened in a wide variety of (free programs) – so if anything breaks or goes off the market, your writing can still be opened and read, in a file format that hasn’t changed for at least four decades.</li>
<li>It’s cool: you’ll look like a weirdo, and you’ll exchange corporate software for something more venerable and unregulated.</li>
</ul>
