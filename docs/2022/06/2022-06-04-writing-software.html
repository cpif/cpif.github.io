        <p>I don’t like Microsoft Word. Or Google Docs. Word crashes;
        its feature list is amazing, but difficult to navigate;
        synchronization problems make it behave erratically; its not
        free. Google Docs is better, but I dislike having to work
        online.</p>
        <p>This past year, I decided to explore alternative options to
        the traditional word processor. At first, my motivations were
        simple: I wanted something with a little more stability and a
        less distracting interface.</p>
        <p>While I was thinking about this, I was unrelatedly exploring
        the utilities available in the UNIX shell. These are small
        little computer programs that do simple tasks – everything from
        listing the files in a directory, to sorting lists
        alphabetically, to printing the current date and time. And more
        complicated things, as well.</p>
        <p>Eventually, these two interests began to converge, and I put
        together – thanks in no small part to the wealth of tutorials
        available online – a writing “stack” that has more-or-less
        replaced Word and Docs for many of my writing tasks.</p>
        <p>I call it a “stack” because most of the features that are
        rolled into one program – the word processor – are now, for me,
        separate programs. This creates a greater degree of flexibility:
        if one of the tools fails, it can be replaced with another,
        while the rest remain stable. All of these are free – and a few
        may already be installed on your computer.</p>
        <h1 id="the-stack">The Stack</h1>
        <p><strong><a href="https://neovim.io/">Nvim</a></strong>: for
        text editing. When I write, this is the program I write in. I’ll
        write more about why I like nvim in particular in a future post.
        For now, the important thing to point out is that any text
        editor will do: Notepad is the default on Windows, TextEdit on
        Mac. All that matters is that the program should edit plain text
        files. These are much simpler, smaller files than Word documents
        or PDFs, and consequently load more quickly and are much less
        prone to crashes. They’re also, usually much less feature-rich
        and therefore less distracting.</p>
        <p><strong><a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a></strong>:
        for typesetting and file conversion. This program converts the
        plaintext files I compose into more familiar formats like Word
        and PDF. It can also convert to PowerPoint, HTML, and a number
        of other formats. Pandoc was developed by John MacFarlane,
        professor of Philosophy at Berkeley.</p>
        <p><strong><a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a></strong>:
        for formatting. Markdown isn’t a program, it’s a convention for
        specifying text formatting. For example, if you type
        <code>*this*</code> or <code>_this_</code>, markdown understands
        that you want to italicize <em>this</em>. If you begin a line
        with <code>&gt;</code> it will understand that line as a
        blockquote. When pandoc converts your text file to Word, it will
        automatically take those formatting symbols into account.</p>
        <p><strong><a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a></strong>: for
        version control. This is the equivalent of Word’s “track
        changes” feature, with a little twist. I like to call it a
        “dumb” version of track changes: it does not automatically keep
        track of changes to your files; instead, it waits for you to ask
        it to note any changes you’ve made, and prompts you to leave a
        comment explaining what you’ve done. This takes a little getting
        used to if, like me, you’re accustomed to software keeping track
        of changes you’ve made automatically. But it forces you to be
        more conscious of and thoughtful about your revision
        process.</p>
        <h1 id="why">Why?</h1>
        <p>Aside from ditching the traditional word processor, here are
        some reasons you might want to explore some of these tools:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>As I said, they’re more stable and more
        distraction-free.</li>
        <li>If you’re worried (or hopeful) that Microsoft will go out of
        business, the files you produce in these ways will still be
        available to you. They can be opened in a wide variety of (free
        programs) – so if anything breaks or goes off the market, your
        writing can still be opened and read, in a file format that
        hasn’t changed for at least four decades.</li>
        <li>It’s cool: you’ll look like a weirdo, and you’ll exchange
        corporate software for something more venerable and
        unregulated.</li>
