# The Aphorism Generator

In Georges Perec's short essay "Think/Classify," he briefly outlines
an aphorism generator designed by fellow OuLiPo writer Marcel Benabou.

This is my incomplete and clumsy implementation of the same.

## To-Do

- [ ] Automatically update the number of forms and noun-pairs (`foreach`
      loop)
- [ ] Add more forms and pairs, of course
- [ ] Ideally, externalize the list of forms and pairs as an external
      document with a more manageable syntax (like YAML?)
